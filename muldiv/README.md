# RISC-V M-Extension Files

In this directory, multiplication and divide modules from [picorv32](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32) are inherited with necessary changes.
picorv32_div_opt.sv and picorv32_pcpi_fast_mul.sv are used by WARP-V.

Other files are for testing the modules independently.
